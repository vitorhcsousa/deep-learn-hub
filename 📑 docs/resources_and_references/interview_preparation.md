1. **Probability and Statistics**:

   - **Probability Theory**:

     Probability theory deals with quantifying uncertainty. It defines the probability of an event occurring, denoted by \( P(A) \), where \( A \) is an event, as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. Mathematically:

     $$ P(A) = \frac{{\text{{Number of favorable outcomes}}}}{{\text{{Total number of possible outcomes}}}} $$

     **Bayes' Theorem**:

     Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. It is stated as:

     $$P(A|B) = \frac{{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}}{{P(B)}}$$

     where:

     - \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event \( A \) given \( B \) has occurred,
     - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event \( B \) given \( A \) has occurred,
     - \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the probabilities of events \( A \) and \( B \) respectively.

     **Probability Distributions**:

     Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. Some common distributions include:

     - **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution**: Defined by its probability density function (PDF):

       ​	$$f(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

       ​	where $ \mu$  is the mean and $ \sigma^2$ is the variance.

     - **Poisson Distribution**: Describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. Its PMF (Probability Mass Function) is:

       ​	$$P(X=k) = \frac{{\lambda^k \cdot e^{-\lambda}}}{{k!}}$$

       ​	where $\lambda$ is the average rate of occurrence.

     - **Bernoulli Distribution**: Represents a binary outcome (success/failure) with probability \( p \) of success. Its PMF is:

       ​	$$P(X=k) = \begin{cases} p & \text{if } k=1 \\ 1-p & \text{if } k=0 \end{cases}$$

     - **Exponential Distribution**:

       - The exponential distribution is often used to model the time until an event occurs in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.
       - Probability Density Function (PDF): $ f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} $
       - where *λ* is the rate parameter.

     - **Uniform Distribution**:

       - In the uniform distribution, all outcomes in an interval are equally likely.
       - Probability Density Function (PDF): $ f(x|a,b) = \frac{1}{b-a} $
       - where *a* and *b* are the lower and upper bounds of the interval, respectively.

     - **Binomial Distribution**:

       - The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
       - Probability Mass Function (PMF):  $P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $
       - where *n* is the number of trials and *p* is the probability of success on each trial.

     - **Geometric Distribution**:

       - The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability *p* of success.
       - Probability Mass Function (PMF): $ P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p  $
       - where *k* is the number of trials needed to achieve the first success.

     - **Gamma Distribution**:

       - The gamma distribution generalizes the exponential distribution to allow for non-integer shape parameters.
       - Probability Density Function (PDF): $f(x|k,\theta) = \frac{x^{k-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)} $
       - where *k* is the shape parameter, *θ* is the scale parameter, and Γ(*k*) is the gamma function.

   - **Descriptive Statistics**:

     Descriptive statistics summarize and describe features of a dataset. Common measures include:

     - **Mean**: Average value of a dataset, calculated as:

       ​	$$bar{x} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}}{n}$$

     - **Median**: Middle value of a dataset when it is sorted, or the average of the middle two values if the dataset has an even number of elements.

     - **Mode**: Most frequent value(s) in a dataset.

     - **Variance**: Measure of the spread of data points around the mean, calculated as:

       ​	$$sigma^2 = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n}$$

     - **Standard Deviation**: Square root of the variance.

   - **Inferential Statistics**:

     - Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics concerned with making inferences or predictions about a population based on sample data. It involves generalizing from a sample to a population, drawing conclusions, and making predictions. Two key techniques in inferential statistics are:

       - **Hypothesis Testing**:

         Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves testing a hypothesis about the population using sample data to determine whether an observed effect is statistically significant or merely due to random variation. The process typically involves setting up a null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) and an alternative hypothesis (\( H_a \)), and then using statistical tests to either accept or reject the null hypothesis. Common hypothesis tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, etc. Hypothesis testing helps researchers and analysts make decisions based on evidence and determine whether the observed differences or effects are meaningful or occurred by chance.
     
         - **p-values**:
         
           In hypothesis testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than a predetermined significance level, commonly 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. Conversely, a large p-value suggests that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. P-values provide a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis and help researchers assess the significance of their findings.
     
       - **Confidence Intervals**:
     
         Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter, along with a level of confidence associated with that interval. They are calculated using sample data and are used to estimate the precision of an estimate. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean represents the range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies. Confidence intervals provide valuable information about the uncertainty associated with sample estimates and help researchers assess the reliability and precision of their findings.

2. **Linear Algebra**:

   - **Vectors and Matrices**:

     Vectors are fundamental mathematical entities representing quantities with both magnitude and direction. In machine learning, they are often used to represent features or data points. Matrices, on the other hand, are rectangular arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns, frequently used to represent transformations or collections of data.

   - **Matrix Operations**:

     Matrix operations are crucial in machine learning for tasks such as transformation, computation, and optimization. Key operations include:

     - Addition: Adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same size.
     
       $$ C = A + B $$

       **Example**:

       Let's consider two matrices:

       $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} $$

       Their sum is computed as:

       $$ C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix} $$

     - Subtraction: Subtracting corresponding elements of two matrices of the same size.

       $$ C = A - B $$

       **Example**:

       Continuing with the matrices \( A \) and \( B \) from the addition example:

       $$ C = A - B = \begin{bmatrix} 1-5 & 2-6 \\ 3-7 & 4-8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -4 & -4 \\ -4 & -4 \end{bmatrix} $$

     - Multiplication: There are different types of matrix multiplication, such as dot product, Hadamard product, and matrix multiplication.

       - Dot product: The dot product of two vectors yields a scalar.

         $$ c = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i $$

       - Matrix multiplication: The matrix product of two matrices results in another matrix.

         $$ C = A \times B $$

       **Example**:

       Let's consider two matrices:

       Their matrix product is computed as:

       $$ C = A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} 1*5+2*7 & 1*6+2*8 \\ 3*5+4*7 & 3*6+4*8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{bmatrix} $$

     - **Matrix Decomposition**:

       Matrix decomposition is the process of breaking down a matrix into constituent parts. This decomposition is often utilized in machine learning for various tasks like dimensionality reduction, solving linear systems, and understanding underlying structures.

       - **Eigen decomposition**: Decomposing a square matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

         $$ A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1} $$

         **Example**:

         Consider a matrix \( A \):

         $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ -2 & 5 \end{bmatrix} $$

         To find eigenvalues (\( \Lambda \)) and eigenvectors (\( Q \)), we solve the characteristic equation \( |A - \lambda I| = 0 \).

         For matrix \( A \), the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 6 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 3 \).

         Corresponding eigenvectors for \( \lambda_1 = 6 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 3 \) are \( Q_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( Q_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) respectively.

         Hence, eigen decomposition results in:

         $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} $$

       - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Factorizing a matrix into singular vectors and singular values.

         $$ A = U \Sigma V^T $$

         **Example**:

         Consider a matrix \( A \):

         $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix} $$

         Performing SVD on \( A \), we obtain:

         - Singular values (\( \Sigma \)):

           $$ \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

           where \( \sigma_1 \) and \( \sigma_2 \) are the singular values.

         - Left singular vectors (\( U \)):

           $$ U = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 & u_2 \end{bmatrix} $$

         - Right singular vectors (\( V^T \)):

           $$ V^T = \begin{bmatrix} v_1^T \\ v_2^T \end{bmatrix} $$

         These components give the factorization of matrix \( A \) as \( A = U \Sigma V^T \).

3. - **Calculus**:

     - **Differentiation and Integration**:

       Differentiation and integration are fundamental concepts in calculus, widely used in machine learning for optimization, modeling, and understanding data.

       - **Differentiation**: Finding the rate at which a function changes. It helps in understanding the slope of a curve at a given point, which is crucial in optimization algorithms like gradient descent.

       - **Integration**: Finding the accumulated sum of quantities. It's used in computing areas under curves, calculating probabilities, and solving differential equations.

     - **Gradient Descent Optimization**:

       Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the function. In machine learning, it's widely used for training models by adjusting parameters to minimize the loss function.

       - **Basic Gradient Descent**: In basic gradient descent, the parameters are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

       - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: SGD is an optimization method that randomly selects a subset of data for each iteration, which makes it faster and more scalable for large datasets.

       - **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between batch gradient descent (using the entire dataset for each iteration) and SGD. It divides the dataset into small batches and updates the parameters based on each batch.

       **Example**:

       Consider a simple optimization problem of finding the minimum of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). We can use gradient descent to minimize this function.

       - **Gradient Calculation**:

         The derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is \( f'(x) = 2x \).

       - **Gradient Descent Update Rule**:

         The update rule for gradient descent is: 

         $$ x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta \cdot f'(x_t) $$

         where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

       - **Example**:

         Let's start with an initial guess \( x_0 = 4 \) and a learning rate \( \eta = 0.1 \). We'll perform three iterations of gradient descent to minimize \( f(x) \).

         1. **Iteration 1**:

            $$ x_1 = x_0 - 0.1 \cdot f'(x_0) = 4 - 0.1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 4 - 0.8 = 3.2 $$

         2. **Iteration 2**:

            $$ x_2 = x_1 - 0.1 \cdot f'(x_1) = 3.2 - 0.1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3.2 = 3.2 - 0.64 = 2.56 $$

         3. **Iteration 3**:

            $$ x_3 = x_2 - 0.1 \cdot f'(x_2) = 2.56 - 0.1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2.56 = 2.56 - 0.512 = 2.048 $$

       After three iterations, we approach the minimum of the function, which is \( x = 0 \).

5. **Model Evaluation and Validation**:

     - **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: The dataset is divided into $$k$$ folds, and the model is trained $$k$$ times, each time using $$k-1$$ folds for training and one fold for validation. The performance is then averaged over all $$k$$ folds.

     - **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**: Each observation in the dataset is used as a validation set, and the model is trained on the remaining observations. This process is repeated for each observation, and the performance is averaged.

     - **Stratified Cross-Validation**: Ensures that each fold has the same proportion of classes as the entire dataset, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

     **Example**:

     Consider a dataset with $$N = 100$$ samples. In 5-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into 5 folds, each containing $$\frac{N}{5} = 20$$ samples. The model is trained and evaluated 5 times, with each fold used as a validation set once.

     - **Accuracy (ACC)**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.

     - **Precision (PR)**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

     - **Recall (Sensitivity) (RE)**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.

     - **F1 Score (F1)**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balances between precision and recall.

     - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier across different threshold values. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

     - **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)**: The area under the ROC curve, which quantifies the overall performance of a binary classifier.

     **Example**:

     Suppose we have a binary classification problem with two classes, "Positive" and "Negative". After training a model, we obtain the following confusion matrix:

     $$
     \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
     \hline
     & \text{Predicted Positive} & \text{Predicted Negative} \\
     \hline
     \text{Positive} & 85 & 15 \\
     \text{Negative} & 5 & 95 \\
     \hline
     \end{array}
     $$

     Using this confusion matrix, we can calculate the performance metrics:

     - **Accuracy (ACC)**:
     $$
     ACC = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}} = \frac{85 + 95}{85 + 15 + 5 + 95} = \frac{180}{200} = 0.9
     $$

     - **Precision (PR)**:
     $$
     PR = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}} = \frac{85}{85 + 15} = \frac{85}{100} = 0.85
     $$

     - **Recall (RE)**:
     $$
     RE = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}} = \frac{85}{85 + 5} = \frac{85}{90} \approx 0.9444
     $$

     - **F1 Score (F1)**:

     $$
     F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{PR} \times \text{RE}}{\text{PR} + \text{RE}} = 2 \times \frac{0.85 \times 0.9444}{0.85 + 0.9444} \approx 0.894
     $$

   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:

     The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the balance between bias and variance in the performance of a model. A model with high bias tends to oversimplify the data, leading to underfitting, while a model with high variance captures noise in the training data, leading to overfitting.

     - **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.
     
     - **Variance**: Error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm.

     **Example**:

     Suppose we're fitting a polynomial regression model to a dataset. A linear model (degree 1) may have high bias but low variance, as it oversimplifies the relationship. Conversely, a high-degree polynomial model may have low bias but high variance, as it fits the training data too closely, capturing noise.

   - **Overfitting**:

     Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations that are not representative of the underlying data distribution. This leads to poor generalization performance on unseen data.

     **Causes**:
     1. **Complex Model**: Using a model with too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available can lead to overfitting.
     2. **Noisy Data**: When the training data contains a lot of noise or outliers, the model may capture this noise instead of the underlying patterns.
     3. **Insufficient Regularization**: Inadequate use of regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization or dropout can fail to prevent overfitting.
     4. **Too Many Training Epochs**: Allowing the model to train for too many epochs can cause it to memorize the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.

     **Ways to Combat**:
     1. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance on multiple subsets of the data and detect overfitting.
     2. **Regularization**: Apply techniques like L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping to prevent the model from fitting the training data too closely.
     3. **Simplify the Model**: Use simpler models with fewer parameters or features to reduce the risk of overfitting.
     4. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Select or engineer features that are most relevant to the task, reducing the chances of the model learning from noise.
     5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models (ensemble methods) to reduce overfitting by capturing diverse patterns in the data.

   - **Underfitting**:

     Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. This results in poor performance both on the training data and on unseen data.

     **Causes**:
     1. **Model Too Simple**: Using a model that lacks the capacity to represent the underlying data distribution can lead to underfitting.
     2. **Insufficient Training**: Not allowing the model to train for enough epochs or not providing enough training data can result in underfitting.
     3. **Ignoring Important Features**: Failing to include important features or considering irrelevant features can lead to underfitting.
     4. **Too Much Regularization**: Excessive use of regularization techniques can overly constrain the model, causing it to underfit the data.

     **Ways to Combat**:
     1. **Increase Model Complexity**: Use more complex models with a greater number of parameters to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
     2. **Add More Features**: Include additional relevant features that may improve the model's ability to learn the underlying relationships in the data.
     3. **Reduce Regularization**: If regularization is too strong, consider reducing its strength or using a different type of regularization.
     4. **Increase Training Data**: Provide more training examples to the model, allowing it to learn more representative patterns in the data.
     5. **Early Stopping**: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when performance begins to degrade, preventing the model from underfitting further.
