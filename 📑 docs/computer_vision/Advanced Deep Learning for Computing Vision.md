In general are three essential computer vision tasks:
- **Image classification**: The goal is to assign one or more labels to an image. 
	- Single-label classification: image can be only in one category
	- multi-label classification: tagging all categories that an image belongs to 
- **Image Segmentation**: The goal is to segment or partition an image into different areas
	- Semantic Segmentation: Each pixel is independently  classified into semantic category
	- Instance Segmentation: Seeks not only to classify image pixels by category, but also to parse individual object instances
- **Object Detection**: The goal is to draw bounding boxes (rectangles) around the objects of interest
