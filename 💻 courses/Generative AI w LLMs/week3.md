# Reinforcement learning and power LLM-powered Applications

[TOC]



### Learning Objectives

------

- Describe how RLHF uses human feedback to improve the performance and alignment of large language models
- Explain how data gathered from human labelers is used to train a reward model for RLHF
- Define chain-of-thought prompting and describe how it can be used to improve LLMs reasoning and planning abilities
- Discuss the challenges that LLMs face with knowledge cut-offs, and explain how information retrieval and augmentation techniques can overcome these challenges
